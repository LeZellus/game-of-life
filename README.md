# Game of Life Documentation

The "Game of Life" is a cellular automaton devised by the mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970. It does not require active players but rather an observer to see how the board's state evolves over time based on predefined rules. It serves as an excellent tool to explore simulation concepts, cellular automata, and chaos theory.

## Introduction

The Game of Life is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input from human players. The player sets up the initial configuration, and the game evolves in steps, following a set of rules related to the state of each cell in a grid.

## Game Rules

The game is played on an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states:
- **Alive**
- **Dead**

Every cell interacts with its eight neighbors, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

1. **Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbors dies, as if by underpopulation.**
2. **Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next generation.**
3. **Any live cell with more than three live neighbors dies, as if by overpopulation.**
4. **Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.**

The initial pattern constitutes the 'seed' of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Game of Life, you need to set up an initial state and observe how it evolves. Here are the steps to follow:

1. Choose the grid size (e.g., 10x10, 100x100).
2. Populate the grid with an initial pattern of live and dead cells.
3. Apply the Game of Life rules to generate the next generation.
4. Repeat step 3 for as many generations as you like.


## FAQ

**Q: What is the best way to simulate large grids?**
A: For larger grids, it is recommended to use simulation software designed for cellular automata like the Game of Life.

**Q: Can the Game of Life simulate real-life scenarios?**
A: Yes, it can model various biological and physical systems, although simplistically.
